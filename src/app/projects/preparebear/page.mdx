Communicating emotions to others is something that all people have to deal with in life in order to maintain their relationships and get support for their issues, but for people struggling with mental illness, this can be simultaneously especially important and especially difficult. Due to the strength and confusing nature of what they feel, it can seem like the world is unsupportive or doesn’t understand, preventing emotions from being expressed. 

In many cases, people fear receiving a bad response from others, and don’t share. It’s something that is hard to build up the courage to do, and people can feel unprepared, unskilled, or anxious in a situation where they want or need to express how they feel. It’s a problem that has very few dedicated resources to help a person overcome their anxieties and feel prepared.

Prepare Bear is a robotic animal device that communicates with its user through speech, similar to Alexa, helping them work through emotions and practice conversations. It practices conversations with a user and gives them practical experience speaking their emotions in a personable and comforting experience. The robot will have interchangeable faces to convey dynamic emotion. It can help a user identify a person to talk to (such as a therapist or friend) and identify conversation goals. The robot can also help them workshop a conversation by incorporating data built over the course of conversations, and also providing feedback based on the user’s goals.

## Design Walkthrough

Talking to the animal will allow a person practical experience speaking about their experiences and gain confidence for a conversation by establishing goals and planning sentences that effectively communicate those goals to another person. It allows users to take control of their emotional needs and the process of preparation in a safe space where a comforting and compassionate companion can support them. The animal will collect information from these conversations and use that and its built-in conversational knowledge to advise effective communication.

## Design Research and Key Insights

We lacked information about the reasons why someone might have trouble expressing their feelings in a conversation
and what people want out of the before and after of a conversation. We knew that knowing the main barriers to 
communication and people's wants would be essential in building our product to overcome those barriers and fit user wants. 

To solve this issue, conducted 3 research activities: two interviews with people who've had experience with therapy and
an online survey released to the online public receiving 36 responses, but with a large portion of responses coming 
from people with self-identified therapy experience. We targeted this demographic because we believed their experience 
with emotional communication would offer greater relevance and insight.

Before coming up with a design, we conducted research to determine to answer two questions:

#### What barriers prevent people from expressing their feelings?

We structured our design research as an interview and survey with questions aimed at collecting people’s experiences with difficulty communicating to see what barriers may exist and understand what we must consider to help reduce those barriers when making our design. The goal was to see what personal, psychological, and cultural factors play a role in people’s willingness to express themselves emotionally, so by using this structure we were able to learn more about these details. 

#### What makes a conversation communicating emotions feel effective?

We structured our design research in both interview and survey form to gauge what needs must be considered when preparing for and actively participating in a discussion of personal emotions, by asking questions on successful conversations and tools and methods for improving communication. The use of an interview was to see what people, on a personal level, tend to prioritize when it comes to communicating successfully about emotions and how to use those main ideas to frame our design. 

The following are three design insights gained from our research.

### Lack of Preparation Tools


Both Interview 1 and 2 identified that the most common way for them to prepare for conversations was for them to run
through the problem and the conversation in their head. Interviewee 2 stated: "Most difficult topics I think about 
for a long time over the course of multiple days. Only when I feel like I'm able to properly communicate my thoughts
to the best of my ability do I tell them to the other person. I have lots of second thoughts most times but I always
prepare myself for the worst that might happen and ask myself if I'm willing to accept it if it comes true."
Interviewee 2 stated: "I guess I would say, I go over the scenario in my head and, I don't know if that's a good or a
bad thing sometimes." Interviewee 1 specifically on multiple occasions expressed a real desire for some sort of tools
that would help a person identify what they're feeling in preparation for communication, finding the right words. 
Many survey responses when asked for what they would want if they could have anything to prepare for a conversation,
couldn't identify a specific thing, as stated above, often writing "something" to help them feel better. One response
wrote, "A guide that tells me about all the emotions and difficult feelings I'm feeling."


All of these statements indicated to us that there was a need for and want for some concrete tool to help prepare for
an emotional conversation, but participants weren't aware of it existing, so ran through the process manually in their
heads, though the amount of certainty or reassurance offered by that preparation method was up in the air.

This identified want motivated our entire project in being a tool that helps prepare for a conversation, and some
specific identified wants by some participants made it into the design as they were the initial inspiration for the
processes. Both the Interview 1 statement and the last survey statement informed our dialogue tree which first helps
a person talk through and identify their feelings about a difficult topic as a precursor to preparing for a
conversation. While we could not offer the omnipentent help that the participants wanted, this helped us identify
the need for a path to assist in processing feelings as part of preparation. Both interviews talking about running
through conversations in their head motivated our preparation phase acting as a practice session and a feedback session
where the conversation partners' response is considered, streamlining this mentioned process of mental runthroughs
into something more structured and with impartial help.


### Concern about how others react deters individuals from opening up

Survey responses included a variety of reasons for why one can be afraid of communicating emotionally such as burdening
the listener or not wanting to come off as vulnerable. Whether it be in the interest of practicing self-care and 
protecting themselves from showing vulnerability or in the interest of the listener by not wanting to “bother/hassle”
them (listener) with troubles, many people do not feel comfortable opening up with their emotions due to how they may
be received.  Quote from one response: “fear of judgement and not wanting to worry them.” Interview 1 also identified
it as one of three major barriers to communication in their life: Participant in full stated “Yeah. I think it’s those two, 
and then just the guilt of worrying or stressing people around me.” 


This shaped our design direction by showing us that a main barrier to commmunication is uncertainty about the reaction
of the other person, and motivating us to include features that could ease this worry by specially considering who the
user wants to speak to and their thoughts about how the other would react and their relationship, and giving feedback
based on this context during the preparation process. This in combination with generally easing worries through a 
concrete process of practice and giving feedback focusing on how to effectively communicate towards a wanted outcome 
attempts to ease this fear and make the user feel more confident in how they'll converse with someone else and more 
hopeful toward a positive outcome.

### People express a strong need for comfort/a way to ease anxiety before a difficult emotional conversation. 


For the survey question asking what they would have to prepare if they could have anything, many answers stated: “Something
that makes me less anxious”, “Something to get rid of that heavy, sick feeling of nervousness”, “A hug from a close
friend or my partner”, “My dog”, “Something that makes me stop crying”, “A way to regulate overwhelming feelings”, etc.
Anxiety was the second most common identified barrier to emotional communication. Interviewee 1 identified worry about 
burdening others as a large barrier to communication, but stated that their therapist and parents reassuring them 
allowed them to overcome that fear and realize they wouldn’t be judged, making communication easier in the future.


This shaped our design direction by emphasizing how important comfort and reassurance are for preparation for a hard
conversation, heavily influencing the concept of our design as something that would appear comforting and sympathetic
and also offer reassurance often. This manifests at many points in our dialogue tree processes, especially our entire
"Sympathetic Responses" system, and one of our end-of-path messages directly being inspired by this Interview 1 insight
which stated that people need to reassured that people in their life are willing to listen.


## Iterative Design and Key Insights

As with other groups, we started by creating a paper prototype of our system, which included our paper prototype bear
and also our two main task dialogue trees we developed. Then we had inspection done by other groups, made edits based
on the heuristic evaluation results we identified as most important, then we did usability testing with three
participants by letting them speak to the physical bear and a tester speaking as the bear following the dialogue trees,
then making small revisions to the prototype in between based on breakdowns encountered. Due to the nature of our
project, what we were testing mainly was our dialogue trees and how people interacted with the process, which in 
usability testing really allowed us to identify problems with natural conversation flow, while heuristic evaluation
helped identify features and best practice inclusions we overlooked because of our unique focus.

### Allowing the User to Control Their Process



<b>Users should have methods for exiting or changing the current system status when they are
dissatisifed or are desiring a change.</b> It was mainly from Usability Testing that many inspectors
identified that our dialogue trees as streamlined processes did not allow for much user control
on when to exit, redo, or navigate in a conversation, and seemed to be guiderailed on a certain 
path, breaking the "User Control" heuristic. We then added a stop tree to shutdown the bear at
any point in the conversation, and a redoing statement function. We also experienced a breakdown
during a usability test where a user stated they didn't like the feedback given and felt like the 
system was forcing them to follow it. It became clear to us that not only should users at any point be
in full control of their position in the process, but also the system's underlying priorities. To
do this, we redesigned the feedback system to allow users to edit their goals and feedback preferences
if not satisfied with feedback received.

### Making System Status and Processing Visible

<b>What the system is doing and how it is interpreting user's input should be made visible to the
user in real time or promptly after data collection.</b> Also from Usability Testing, we received
many reports identifying a lack of visible state and prompt feedback in violation of the "System
Visibility" heuristic. Due to our system being predominantly a speech interface, we didn't have
many initial points where feedback was given to the user as we focused on developing a dialogue
process, but we realized on the technical side and for clarity this was essential. Using our defined
facial system that previously existed just to add a responsive human element, we added facial states 
that representing thinking and receiving input so that the user would be aware in real time that the
system is pausing to process or that their audio is being picked up and listened to. Where this
insight heavily factored into our iteration is our consideration of a change for exclusion, where
we considered how to handle harder-to-parse accents or speech styles, and realized the whole system
would benefit from more checkpoints after data collection segments where the collected information
is reported back to the user and the user is able to edit errors. We added many checkpoints along our
dialogue trees in consideration of this, giving users that feedback soon after collection.

### Suppporting Natural Conversation Diversions

        {
            src: sympathytree,
            alt: "System for responding to user context.",
            caption: "New sympathy logic applicable to user context",

<b>Divergences from the main conversation tree are normal in a user interaction, and should be
supported, especially in cases where the user experience will benefit from the diversion.</b> This
insight came mostly from usability testing, where across tests many system breaks occured when
the user asked questions or made statements that were not anticipated by the dialogue tree. 
Participant 2 in particular asked many questions for advice and clarification. Participant 3 gave
the feedback that the current process felt like a systematic interrogation in the way the system
asked series of questions without interruption. This identified to us that the rigid trees created
needed to allow for natural sideroads in conversation, and the user could even benefit from
divergences in the form of questions.

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={
        {
            src: questiontree,
            alt: "System for answering questions.",
            caption: "Logic for when user asks a question to Prepare Bear",
        }}
    width={12}
    maxHeight={"400px"}

 So, we added a question-taking tree to our system, a sympathetic
response system that made the system respond more naturally to user speech in between tree nodes, and
an error tree handling all other diversions with a reminder of system state and ability to redirect
if needed. We believe all of these changes improve user experience with improved natural dialogue, 
offering more user assistance, and handling error cases in defined ways.
